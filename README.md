# historical games

I'm part of a collective of game designers called [MÃ¡quina Tudo](https://maquinatudo.com.br/). In October and November 2023 we traveled with other groups of artists to 12 cities in an itinerant festival called [Circuito Sesc de Artes](https://circuito.sescsp.org.br/cidades/). This event gave rise to a project to create an encyclopedia of historical games from around the world.


In this repository is one of the research tools designed to assist in the research process of the games that are being selected for publication. It uses a large language model (LLM), LangChain, and data from Wikipedia to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project.
