The game is often associated with gambling activities, given its competitive nature. Yoté has a relation to the game Choko, indicating a linkage in their game rules or play styles.\\n\\nThis game is played on a 5×6 board and each player begins the game with twelve pieces in hand. The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent\\'s pieces. The players take turns, starting with the white pieces. The game allows for different kinds of moves, including placing a piece on any empty cell of the board, moving a piece already on the board to an adjacent cell, or capturing an opponent\\'s piece. There are also optional rules that allow for additional strategic layers, such as multiple successive jumps in a single turn, or capturing entitling the player to a bonus turn.\\n\\nYoté is a game that has stood the test of time, continuing to be played in the modern era. However, there doesn\\'t appear to be any specific religious or festive association with the game. The game is mentioned in several books, including \"Games of the World\" by Frederic V. Grunfeld and \"The Games of Africa\" by Jennifer Prior, underscoring its cultural significance and popularity across continents.
